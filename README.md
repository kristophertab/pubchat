# PUB Chat

The purpose of PUB Chat is to create an online communication experience similar to a real-live pub discussion.
The basic concept is to allow users to move in two dimensional space where the sound volume is proportional to the distance between them.
This allow users to talk with everyone, but with some more then the others.

The main goal for pub chat is to maximize people's happiness during development and usage. So, grab your beer and have a fun :)
